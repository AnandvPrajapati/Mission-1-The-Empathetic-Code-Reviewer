        analysis_prompt = f"""
I need you to transform critical code review comments into empathetic, educational feedback. The goal is to maintain the technical accuracy while making the feedback supportive and growth-oriented.

CONTEXT:
- Programming Language: {language}
- Code Snippet:
```{language}
{code_snippet}
```

REVIEW COMMENTS TO TRANSFORM:
{json.dumps([item['comment'] for item in comment_analysis], indent=2)}

COMMENT SEVERITY ANALYSIS:
{json.dumps(comment_analysis, indent=2)}

TRANSFORMATION FRAMEWORK:

For each review comment, create a section with:

1. **Positive Rephrasing**: Transform the criticism into encouraging, supportive language
   - Acknowledge what's working well in the code
   - Frame improvements as opportunities rather than failures
   - Use "we" language to create partnership feeling
   - Adjust tone based on severity (gentle for critical, encouraging for minor)

2. **The 'Why'**: Provide clear, educational explanation of the underlying principle
   - Explain the software engineering principle being addressed
   - Connect to real-world implications (performance, maintainability, readability)
   - Use analogies or examples when helpful
   - Show the broader context of why this matters

3. **Suggested Improvement**: Provide concrete, working code examples
   - Show the improved version of the code
   - Explain what makes the improvement better
   - Include multiple approaches when appropriate
   - Make the code production-ready and well-commented

4. **Learning Resources**: Include 1-2 relevant documentation links or resources

5. **Contextual Adaptation**: 
   - For CRITICAL severity: Use extra gentleness and reassurance
   - For MAJOR severity: Focus on the learning opportunity
   - For MINOR severity: Be encouraging and supportive
   - For STYLE severity: Frame as professional polish

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate a holistic summary at the end that encourages continued growth
- Use encouraging language throughout ("Great start!", "I love that you...", "This shows good thinking...")
- Focus on the developer's potential and progress
- Make each explanation educational and memorable
- Ensure all code examples are syntactically correct and represent best practices

Format your response as a professional Markdown report with clear sections and proper code blocks.

## Analysis Error Recovery

I encountered an issue while generating the full empathetic analysis. Here's a basic supportive framework:

### Code Review Comments Transformation

{chr(10).join([f"**Original**: {comment}{chr(10)}**Supportive Approach**: Let's explore how we can improve this area together.{chr(10)}" for comment in review_comments])}

### Code Snippet Analysis
```python
{code_snippet}
```

### Encouragement
Every developer is on a learning journey, and code reviews are valuable opportunities for growth. The suggestions provided are meant to help you write even better code and develop stronger programming skills.

*Note: This is a fallback analysis due to API limitations. The full system would provide detailed, empathetic feedback for each comment.*

## Error Analysis

The Empathetic Code Reviewer encountered an issue while processing your request. This could be due to:

### Possible Causes
- **Input Format**: Ensure JSON contains 'code_snippet' and 'review_comments' keys
- **API Limits**: OpenAI API quotas or rate limits may have been exceeded
- **Network Issues**: Temporary connectivity problems
- **Invalid Code**: Code snippet may contain parsing issues

### Recommended Solutions
1. **Verify Input Format**: Ensure your input follows the required JSON structure
2. **Check API Key**: Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has available credits
3. **Try Again**: Temporary issues often resolve with retry
4. **Use Demo Mode**: Run the demo version to see expected output format

### Example Input Format
```json
{{
  "code_snippet": "def example_function():\n    return 'Hello World'",
  "review_comments": ["This function could be improved", "Consider adding documentation"]
}}
```

Even when encountering technical issues, remember that the goal of code review is always to support your growth as a developer. Technical difficulties are just part of the programming journey!
