## üí° Key Innovation Features

### 1. Contextual Awareness (Major Stand-Out Feature)
- **Severity Classification**: Automatically detects harsh vs gentle criticism
- **Adaptive Tone**: Adjusts empathy level based on comment harshness
- **Language Detection**: Optimizes feedback for specific programming languages

### 2. Educational Resource Integration
- **Smart Linking**: Provides relevant documentation links
- **Best Practices**: Connects feedback to software engineering principles
- **Learning Paths**: Suggests next steps for improvement

### 3. Holistic Summary Generation
- **Growth Mindset**: Encourages continued learning and development
- **Positive Psychology**: Focuses on potential rather than failures
- **Professional Development**: Frames feedback as career growth opportunities

## üìä Input/Output Format

### Required Input (JSON)
```json
{
  "code_snippet": "def get_users():\n    return users",
  "review_comments": [
    "This is inefficient",
    "Variable names are unclear", 
    "Missing error handling"
  ]
}
```

### Generated Output (Markdown)
```markdown
# Empathetic Code Review Report

## Analysis of Comment: "This is inefficient"

* **Positive Rephrasing:** "Great start on the logic! Let's explore how we can make this even more performant..."
* **The 'Why':** [Educational explanation of efficiency principles]
* **Suggested Improvement:** [Concrete code examples with improvements]
* **Learning Resources:** [Relevant documentation links]

## Review Summary & Encouragement
[Holistic, encouraging summary that promotes growth mindset]
```

## üé™ Sample Output Quality

The solution produces exceptionally empathetic, educational feedback:

```markdown
## Analysis of Comment: "Variable 'u' is a bad name."

* **Positive Rephrasing:** "I love how you're thinking about efficiency in your loop! To make this code even more maintainable and readable for your teammates (and your future self), let's give that variable a more descriptive name that clearly communicates its purpose."

* **The 'Why':** Clear variable naming is one of the most important aspects of writing maintainable code. When you or someone else reads this code in six months, descriptive names immediately communicate the purpose and context...

* **Suggested Improvement:**
    ```python
    for user in users:  # Much clearer than 'u'
        if user.is_active and user.profile_complete:
            results.append(user)
    ```

* **Learning Resources:**
  - [PEP 8 Naming Conventions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)
```
